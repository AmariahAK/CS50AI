TRAFFIC SIGN CLASSIFICATION PROJECT <https://youtu.be/1UvGiaAtPvE>
Overview
This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying traffic signs using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. The implementation is done in Python using the TensorFlow and OpenCV libraries.

Implementation
load_data Function
The load_data function reads and preprocesses images from the provided data directory. Each image is loaded using OpenCV, resized to the specified dimensions (IMG_WIDTH and IMG_HEIGHT), and normalized. The function returns a tuple of images and corresponding labels.

get_model Function
The get_model function defines a CNN architecture using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers. The output layer has NUM_CATEGORIES units with softmax activation, suitable for multi-class classification. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.

Experimentation Process
During the development of this project, several experiments were conducted to optimize the model architecture. Here are some key points from the experimentation process:

Layer Configuration: Different combinations of convolutional and pooling layers were tried to find a suitable architecture for feature extraction.

Filter Sizes and Numbers: Various filter sizes and numbers of filters in convolutional layers were experimented with to capture different levels of features in the images.

Hidden Layer Sizes: The size of the hidden dense layer was adjusted to balance the model's capacity and prevent overfitting.

Dropout: Dropout layers were added to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.

Training Epochs: The number of training epochs was tuned to prevent underfitting or overfitting.

Results
The final model achieved satisfactory performance on the test set, demonstrating its ability to classify traffic signs accurately. The model was saved for future use, and the performance metrics were evaluated.

Usage
To run the project, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python traffic.py data_directory [model.h5]
data_directory: Path to the directory containing traffic sign images.
model.h5 (optional): File to save the trained model.
Conclusion
The project successfully implements a CNN for traffic sign classification. Further optimizations and experimentation can be performed to enhance the model's performance, such as data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and exploring more complex architectures.
